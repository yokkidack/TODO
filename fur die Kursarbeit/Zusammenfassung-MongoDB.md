Where relational databases have tables, MongoDB has collections. In other words, MySQL (a popular relational database) keeps its data in tables of rows, while MongoDB keeps its data in collections of documents, which you can think of as a group of documents.
Internally, MongoDB stores documents in a format called Binary JSON, or BSON.
In theory, each document in a collection can have a completely different structure; in practice, a collectionâ€™s document will be relatively uniform.

MONGO DB supports Ad hoc queries

MDB allows using up to 64 indexes per collection (as opposed to single primery key in SQL DB)
