Where relational databases have tables, MongoDB has collections. In other words, MySQL (a popular relational database) keeps its data in tables of rows, while MongoDB keeps its data in collections of documents, which you can think of as a group of documents.
Internally, MongoDB stores documents in a format called Binary JSON, or BSON.
